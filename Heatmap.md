## Heatmap:
The heatmap is used to display the correlation matrix of the numerical data from the DataFrame. A correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients between many variables. Each cell in the table shows the correlation between two variables.

In our case, the heatmap shows the correlation between the following numerical variables:
- 'Score'
- 'View Count'
- 'Answer Count'
- 'Owner Reputation' 

Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (meaning they change together at a constant rate). It is a common tool for understanding the relationship between multiple variables and features in your dataset.

The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1:
- A correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that as one variable goes up, the other goes down.
- A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, meaning that as one variable goes up, the other goes up.
- A correlation of 0 indicates that there is no linear relationship between the variables.

In the heatmap, the closer the color of the cell is to 1 (or to -1), the stronger the positive (or negative) correlation between the two variables. The closer the color of the cell is to 0, the weaker the correlation. Usually, the colors will be represented in a gradient form, so you can visualize the strength of the correlations.
